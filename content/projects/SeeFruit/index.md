- Android app which identifies a fruit and displays nutritional content of the
  fruit when the phone's camera is pointed at the fruit.

- The application uses a retrained inception v3 model (retrained only on fruit
  images).

- This application was inspired from Jian Yang's 'SeeFood' app in Silicon Valley
  TV series.
